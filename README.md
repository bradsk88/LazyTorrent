When clicking the button "I want to download this" from the "Manual Control" pane, you are expected to reformat the file name so that future downloads will be matchable.   

For example:   
Select file "My.New.File.To.Download.S01.E10.COOLGUYS.xVid.US.TV"  
Click "I want to download this"  
In the new dialog, change the name to "My.New.File.To.Download"   
In the future, file like "My.New.File.To.Download.S02.E99.NOTCOOL.h264.REPACK" will automatically be downloaded and will be 
transferred to \\{{{tv-dest}}}\\{{{THIS_YEAR}}}\My New File To Download.  
--Where {{{THIS_YEAR}}} will be the current year.  Eg: 2014.  
--Where {{{tv-dest}}} is the tv-dest directory specified on the first run of the application.
